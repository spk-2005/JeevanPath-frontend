# Voice Search Enhancement - Sorting and Filtering

## Overview
Enhanced the voice recognition system to handle sophisticated sorting and filtering commands through text input.

## New Features

### 1. Enhanced Sorting Commands
The system now understands various sorting commands:

**English Examples:**
- "sort by rating" / "sort by highest rating"
- "give highest rating resources in sorted order"
- "arrange by distance" / "sort by location"
- "sort alphabetically" / "sort by name"
- "show top rated resources"

**Multi-language Support:**
- Hindi: "रेटिंग के अनुसार क्रमबद्ध करें"
- Telugu: "రేటింగ్ ప్రకారం క్రమబద్ధీకరించండి"

### 2. Enhanced Filtering Commands
**Show All Resources:**
- "show all resources"
- "display everything" 
- "complete list"
- "list all facilities"

**Quality Filters:**
- "highest rating resources"
- "best rated clinics"
- "top quality hospitals"

**Availability Filters:**
- "open now"
- "currently available"
- "facilities open today"

### 3. Combined Commands
The system can handle complex commands that combine multiple operations:
- "give highest rating resources in sorted order"
- "show all clinics sorted by distance"
- "find best rated hospitals near me"

## Technical Implementation

### Backend NLP Service
- Added new keyword categories: `sorting`, `filters`
- Enhanced entity extraction for sorting parameters
- New intent types: `sort`, `filter`
- Improved navigation generation with sorting parameters

### Frontend Processing
- Enhanced fallback processing for Expo Go compatibility
- Improved command understanding with better keyword detection
- Added sophisticated response generation
- Updated HomeScreen to handle voice-driven sorting

### Voice Search Popup
- Added new example commands
- Enhanced quick options with sorting examples
- Improved placeholder text with sorting hints
- Better conversational responses

## Usage Examples

### Text Input Examples (works in Expo Go):
1. Type: "give highest rating resources in sorted order"
   - Result: Shows all resources sorted by rating (highest first)

2. Type: "sort by distance"
   - Result: Sorts current resources by distance (nearest first)

3. Type: "show all resources"
   - Result: Displays all available resources without type filters

4. Type: "find best rated clinics"
   - Result: Shows clinics with high ratings

### Voice Commands (works in development builds):
- Say any of the above commands
- System will process, respond, and navigate automatically
- Supports multiple languages

## Integration with HomeScreen

The enhanced system seamlessly integrates with the existing HomeScreen sorting functionality:
- Voice commands automatically set the `sortBy` parameter
- Filter parameters are applied to the resource search
- Existing UI controls remain functional
- Users can further refine results using manual controls

## Benefits

1. **Natural Language Processing**: Users can speak or type naturally
2. **Multi-modal Input**: Works with both voice and text input
3. **Intelligent Responses**: Provides contextual feedback
4. **Seamless Navigation**: Automatically applies filters and navigates
5. **Accessibility**: Text input fallback ensures compatibility
6. **Multi-language Support**: Works in English, Hindi, and Telugu

## Testing

To test the enhanced functionality:
1. Open the voice search popup
2. Try typing: "give highest rating resources in sorted order"
3. Observe the conversational response
4. Check that the HomeScreen shows resources sorted by rating
5. Try other sorting commands like "sort by distance"

The system now provides a much more intuitive and powerful way to search and organize healthcare resources through natural language commands.
